If you want to make a Discord Bot, you need to go to [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)

I will show you the step-by-step process of how to do it   

Basic configuration

- `app/token`, the token of the bot available on the [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) section
- `app/playing`, the activity of the bot
- `app/global`, whether the commands will work on all servers or just one (if global, they might take up to an hour to show up)
- `app/guild`, the guild the slash command will be loaded to (this only applies if global is set to false)
- `app/extraMessages` will increase the amount of bot spam, while you get more information (not recommended)

 - `app/lang` will change the bot client language [__**See below for supported language codes**__]

- `app/Translate_Timeout` will set the time limit the bot has to create the translation successfully. If the time is out, only the original English version will be printed. Set to `none` if you want to disable it (No Timeout). 

- `app/enableEmojis` will change the player buttons with emojis if set to true. `false` will replace them with basic English words

- `opt/loopMessage`, if the message that music is played should be sent when it is looped
